# refresh.py
#
# A standalone script that acts as a "database refresher" for SuperSexySteam.
# Currently contains no logic as per user request - this is a placeholder
# that can be implemented in the future.
#
# Future workflow will include:
# 1. Reads 'config.ini' to get the user-configured Steam path.
# 2. Uses lua_parser.py to scan and parse all .lua files for depot data.
# 3. Uses vdf_updater.py to update Steam's config.vdf with depot keys.
# 4. Uses depot_cache_manager.py to manage Steam's depotcache folder.
