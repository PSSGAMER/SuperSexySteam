## üîß Build & Distribution

### üî® Automated Build Process
SuperSexySteam includes a comprehensive PowerShell build script located in the `buildtools` directory:

```powershell
# Run the automated build script from project root
.\buildtools\build.ps1
```

**The build script automatically:**
- Creates a clean virtual environment
- Installs all dependencies from requirements.txt
- Builds the executable using PyInstaller
- Creates a release.zip in the buildtools folder
- Packages everything into a distribution-ready SuperSexySteam.zip
- Cleans up temporary files

### Distribution Package Structure
The build process creates `buildtools\SuperSexySteam.zip` containing:
- `release.zip` - The main application files
- `install.ps1` - PowerShell installation script
- `install.bat` - Batch wrapper for installation with admin privileges

### üöÄ Installation from Build
After building, users can install by:
1. Extracting the `SuperSexySteam.zip` file
2. Running `install.bat` (which launches `install.ps1` with admin privileges)

The installer will:
- Add Windows Defender exclusions
- Extract files to `%AppData%\Roaming\SuperSexySteam`
- Create desktop shortcuts
- Set up the application for immediate use

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

#### Steam Not Detected
- Verify Steam installation path in configuration
- Ensure Steam.exe is in the specified directory
- Check for Steam process conflicts

#### Steam Client Stuck at Loading
- Result of using offline mode with our app
- To fix it, simply run steam from inside the main app once

#### Antivirus Issues
- Add an exclusion for your antivirus to `%AppData%\Roaming\SuperSexySteam`

#### Achievement Issues
- You are not recommended to switch Steam accounts unless you do not care about the achievements
- If you want to switch accounts and also have offline achievements, rememember to only use this app with one account as it stores the currently logged SteamID for achievements at first boot
