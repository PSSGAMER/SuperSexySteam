# SuperSexySteam

A powerful tool for Steam depot management that works in conjunction with GreenLuma. This tool helps you manage Steam depot files and provides an intuitive interface for processing .lua and .manifest files.

**Note:** GreenLuma by Steam006 is included for convenience. If Steam006 has any concerns, please contact me and I will remove it. The eventual plan is to implement a custom emulator solution.

2. **Process Content** (simplified drag-and-drop workflow)
   - Launch SuperSexySteam
   - Drag `.lua` files (and any associated `.manifest` files) into the interface
   - Click "Apply" to automatically trigger the complete processing pipeline:

     - ‚úÖ **Depot Cache Processing** - Copies manifest files to Steam's depot cache
     - ‚úÖ **Steam Config Update** - Updates config.vdf with depot decryption keys
     - ‚úÖ **ACF Generation** - Creates Steam app manifests for game recognition

3. **Start Steam**
   - Launch "DLL Injector" to start Steam with GreenLuma
