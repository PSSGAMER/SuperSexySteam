# SuperSexySteam

This is a tool that tricks makes use of the cache feature of steam to download games, and works in conjuction with GreenLuma. This is a beta release. I have packed GreenLuma by Steam006 with my code for convinience. This is not professional, and Steam006 can contact me and I will remove it. The eventual plan is to move away from GreenLuma due to its closed source nature and implement my own emulator. This will be done once my scripts are refined to perfection

The README is a WIP

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of SuperSexySteam up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

*   **Python:** Version 3.8 or newer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **Git:** Required to clone the repository. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Installation

These steps will guide you through cloning the repository and setting up a clean, isolated environment for the project.

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to download the project files:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/PSSGAMER/SuperSexySteam.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Change your current directory to the newly created project folder:
    ```sh
    cd SuperSexySteam
    ```

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment**

    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated from your system's global Python installation. Run the following command:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    This creates a new folder named `venv` in your project directory.

4.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    You must activate the environment before installing packages. The command differs based on your operating system.

    *   **On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):**
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    *   **On macOS & Linux:**
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with `(venv)`, indicating the environment is active.

5.  **Install Required Packages**

    With your virtual environment active, use `pip` to install the necessary Python libraries for the application:
    ```sh
    pip install customtkinter tkinterdnd2 Pillow
    ```
6. **Setting up GreenLuma

    Go to SuperSexySteam/GreenLuma/NormalMode and run GreenLumaSettings_2025.exe. Choose option 2 and follow the instructions

### Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can launch SuperSexySteam with a single command:

```sh
python SuperSexySteam.py
```

#### First-Time Setup

The very first time you run the application, it will detect that `config.ini` is missing and will guide you through a one-time setup:

1.  A pop-up window will ask for your **Steam installation path**. You can leave it empty to use the default (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`).
2.  A second pop-up will ask for your **GreenLuma directory**. You can leave it empty to default to a `GreenLuma` folder present inside the project directory.

After confirming these paths, the settings will be saved to `config.ini`, and the main application will launch. This setup process will not occur on subsequent launches.

Enjoy!!
