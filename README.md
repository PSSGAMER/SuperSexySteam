### Automated Build Process
SuperSexySteam includes a comprehensive PowerShell build script located in the `buildtools` directory:

```powershell
# Run the automated build script from project root
.\buildtools\build.ps1
```

**The build script automatically:**
- Creates a clean virtual environment
- Installs all dependencies from requirements.txt
- Builds the executable using PyInstaller
- Creates a release.zip in the buildtools folder
- Packages everything into a distribution-ready SuperSexySteam.zip
- Cleans up temporary files

### Distribution Package Structure
The build process creates `buildtools\SuperSexySteam.zip` containing:
- `release.zip` - The main application files
- `install.ps1` - PowerShell installation script  
- `install.bat` - Batch wrapper for installation with admin privileges

### Installation from Build
After building, users can install by:
1. Extracting the `SuperSexySteam.zip` file
2. Running `install.bat` (which launches `install.ps1` with admin privileges)

The installer will:
- Add Windows Defender exclusions
- Extract files to `%AppData%\Roaming\SuperSexySteam`
